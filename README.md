# Union Types with Disjoint Case Expression and Intersection Types

Objective of this work is to develop a sound, complete, type-safe and deterministic
calculus for union types with disjoint case expression and intersection types.

## Code Structure

Coq folder in each respective direcotry contains coq formalization of the respective system.
