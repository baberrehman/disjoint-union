\section{The Union Calculus (\name)}
\label{sec:union}

This section introduces the union calculus \name. The distinctive feature
of the \name calculus is a type-based switch expression with disjoint
cases, which can be used to eliminate values with union types.
An interesting aspect of the operational
semantics is that it is type-directed,
and type annotations
play a fundamental role in the dynamic semantics.
%Such type-based
%switch expression is inspired by a similar construct in the Ceylon programming
%language.
We also adapt the notion of disjointness from previous work on
\emph{disjoint intersection types}~\cite{oliveira2016disjoint} to \name, and show that \name is type
sound and deterministic.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Syntax
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Syntax}\label{sec:union:syntax}
\Cref{fig:union:syntax} shows the syntax for \cal. Metavariables
$[[A]]$, $[[B]]$ and $[[C]]$ range over types.  Types include top ($[[Top]]$),
bottom ($[[Bot]]$), function ($[[A -> B]]$) and union ($[[A \/ B]]$)
types. Metavariable $[[e]]$ ranges over program
expressions. Expressions include variables ($[[x]]$), integers
($[[i]]$), type annotations ($[[e:A]]$), lambda abstractions
($[[\x.e]]$), applications ($[[e1 e2]]$) and a novel switch expression ($[[switch
    e A e1 B e2]]$). The \emph{switch} expression evaluates a specific branch by matching the
type.
%Details of \typeof expression will further be discussed in typing
%and operational semantics sections.

\paragraph{Values and pre-values}

In \name there are two kinds of values ($[[v]]$): annotated values $[[w]]$; and unannotated
lambda expressions ($[[\x.e]]$). In annotated values, which have the form $[[p
:A]]$, the type annotation $[[A]]$ represents the \textit{static type} of the
value.
%We divide the representation for values into three parts: pre-values,
%annotated values and values.
Metavariable $[[p]]$ ranges over pre-values. Pre-values
consist of integers $[[i]]$
and annotated lambda expressions $[[\x.e : A -> B]]$.
%Annotated values are pre-values with an additional type annotation i.e. $[[p:A]]$.
It is important to note that $[[i]]$ is not a value in this
calculus, instead $[[i:Int]]$ or $[[i:Top]]$ are values.
We have unannotated lambda expressions ($[[\x.e]]$) as values, as
\name employs bi-directional type-checking, where
unannotated lambda expressions can be arguments of functions, and
may appear as a result of reducing such arguments.
Annotated lambda values have two annotations;
that is, $[[\x.e : A -> B : C]]$ is a value.
As already mentioned, $C$ is the static type of the value,
whereas $[[A -> B]]$ is the \emph{dynamic} (or more precise)
type  of the lambda.
As we will see, the distinction between dynamic and static
types is important for the \textit{type-directed operational semantics}
\cite{Huang:typedirected}.
For readers familiar with calculi with gradual types~\cite{Siek06gradualtyping}, the two annotations
can be also be understood as the \emph{source type} and \emph{target type}
of an upcast: i.e. if the value is well-typed we have that $[[A -> B]] <: [[C]]$.

Finally, a context ($[[G]]$) maps variables to their associated types. A typing
mode ($[[dirflag]]$), as in traditional bi-directional type checking, can either be the
inference mode ($[[=>]]$) or the checking mode ($[[<=]]$).

\subsection{Subtyping}
\label{sec:union:sub}
The subtyping rules for \cal are shown in
\Cref{fig:union:syntax}. The rules are standard.
\Rref{s-top} states that all types are subtypes of
the $[[Top]]$ type. \Rref{s-bot} states that $[[Bot]]$ type is subtype of
all types. \Rref{s-int, s-arrow} are standard rules for integers and
functions respectively.  Functions are contravariant in input types
and covariant in output types. \Rref{s-ora,s-orb,s-orc} deal with
subtyping for union types. \Rref{s-ora} says that the union type of two types $[[A]]$ and $[[B]]$
is a subtype of another type $[[C]]$ if both $[[A]]$ and $[[B]]$ are subtypes of
$[[C]]$. \Rref{s-orb,s-orc} state that if a
type is subtype of one of the components of a union type, then it is subtype of whole
union type.
The subtyping relation for \cal is reflexive and transitive.

%\snow{The link for s-orc is lost. Maybe we need to use ``and \rref{s-orc}" instead? Can we use $B$ instead of $A$ in the three union rules to make them
%more readable?}
%\ningning{This can be fixed by not putting extra space between rules or
%  otherwise it will break the hyperlinks. Baber can you fix other ones? There

%% Disjointness
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Disjointness}
\label{sec:union:disj}
Now we turn to the notion of disjointness for
switch expressions in \cal. In essence, disjointness for \cal is
the dual to the disjointness notion in $\lambda_i$~\cite{oliveira2016disjoint},
a calculus with disjoint intersection types.
In $\lambda_i$, two
types in are disjoint if they do not share any common
\emph{supertype} which is not \emph{top-like} (i.e., isomorphic to the top type). Dually, in
\cal, two types are disjoint if they do not share any common \emph{subtype} which
is not \emph{bottom-like}.
%We emphasize the significance of
%\emph{supertypes} and \emph{subtypes} in $\lambda_i$ and \cal
%respectively.

\paragraph{Bottom-Like Types}
\emph{Bottom-like} types are types that are isomorphic (i.e.
both supertypes and subtypes) of the bottom type $\bot$. Therefore,
\emph{bottom-like} types behave like the $[[Bot]]$ type.
In \name, there
are infinitely many such types, including, for example $\bot \lor \bot$,
$\bot \lor \bot \lor \bot$, as well as $\bot$ itself.
%Bottom-like types
%are important because they allow us to define disjointness.
%are integral part of disjoitness in \cal like
%\emph{top-like} in $\lambda_i$ \cite{oliveira2016disjoint}. Therefore,
%it is important to understand the notion of \emph{bottom-like} types
%before diving into the details of disjointness.

An inductive definition that captures all the \emph{bottom-like} types
is shown at the top of \Cref{fig:union:disj-typ}.
Type $[[Bot]]$ is obviously a \emph{bottom-like} type
(\rref{bl-bot}), and a union type of two \emph{bottom-like} types is also
a \emph{bottom-like} type (\rref{bl-or}).  It is trivial to conclude
that a union type is \emph{bottom-like} only if all the
types in union are $[[Bot]]$. The correctness of our definition for
\emph{bottom-like} types is established by the following properties:

%\snow{Why we need an extra definition for bottom-like rather than
%directly using ``A<:Bot"? And the notation overlaps with the
%DynamicType function later.}
%\ningning{It's just nice to have a standalone and inductive definition I think.}
%\ningning{And yes, Baber, please fix the notation. Maybe use $\lceil this
%  \rceil$  and $\lfloor this \rfloor$ for later functions? Or use one of them
%  for disjointness.  }

\begin{lemma}[Bottom-Like Soundness]
  If \ $[[botlike A]]$ \ then \ $[[A <: B]]$.
\label{lemma:union:bl-soundness}
\end{lemma}

\begin{comment}
\begin{proof}
  By induction on bottom-like relation.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item All cases are trivial to prove.
  \end{itemize}
\end{proof}
\end{comment}

\begin{lemma}[Bottom-Like Completeness]
  If \ $[[A <: Bot]]$ \ then \ $[[botlike A]]$.
\label{lemma:union:bl-completeness}
\end{lemma}

\noindent The soundness lemma states that if a type is \emph{bottom-like}, then it is
a subtype of any other type (and, in particular, it is a subtype of $[[Bot]]$).
The completeness lemma states that if $[[A]]$ is a subtype of $[[Bot]]$ then
$[[A]]$ is \emph{bottom-like}.

\begin{comment}
\begin{proof}
  By induction on type $[[A]]$.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Cases $[[Top]]$, $[[Bot]]$, $[[Int]]$ and $[[A -> B]]$ are trivial to prove.
    \item Case $[[A \/ B]]$ requires \Cref{lemma:union:sub-or}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{proof}
\end{comment}

\paragraph{Declarative Disjointness}
The declarative definition for disjointness is as follows:
%Recall that two types in \cal are disjoint if they do not share any common subtype which is not
%\emph{bottom-like}. The formal definition of disjoint specifications for this calculus is:

\begin{definition}
  A $*_s$ B $\Coloneqq$ $\forall$ C, $[[C <: A]]$ $\wedge$ $[[C <: B]]$ $\Longrightarrow$ $[[botlike C]]$
\label{def:union:disj}
\end{definition}

\noindent That is, two types are disjoint if all their common subtypes are \emph{bottom-like}.
\begin{comment}
With this definition we have that different primitive types are disjoint. For example
$[[Int]] * [[Bool]]$ since the only common subtypes of $[[Int]]$ and $[[Bool]]$
are bottom-like. A more interesting case is the disjointness of two function types.
It turns out that function types are never disjoint, since we can always find
a common subtype for any two function types. For example, if we have $[[Int -> Bool]]$
and $[[String -> Char]]$ then a common subtype that is not bottom-like is
$[[Top -> Bot]]$. Therefore, $[[Int -> Bool]]$ and $[[String -> Char]]$ are not
disjoint.

\noindent Reader may think at this point that $[[Bot]]$ type can simply be used in \Cref{def:union:disj}
instead of $[[botlike C]]$ in the conclusion. Answer to this question is
union type with $[[Bot]]$ as all primitive types is also a least subtype in \cal.
$[[botlike C]]$ also handles this case.
\end{comment}
We illustrate this definition with a few examples:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\boldsymbol{A = [[Int]], \ B = \ [[Int -> Bool]]:}$
        $[[Int]]$ and $[[Int -> Bool]]$ are disjoint types. All common subtypes
        of $[[Int]]$ and $[[Int -> Bool]]$ are \emph{bottom-like} types,
        including $[[Bot]]$ and unions of $[[Bot]]$ types.
  \item $\boldsymbol{A = [[Int \/ Bool]], \ B = \ [[Bot]]:}$
    $[[Int \/ Bool]]$ and $[[Bot]]$ are disjoint types. Again all common subtypes are \emph{bottom-like}.
    In general, the type $[[Bot]]$ (or any \emph{bottom-like} type)
    is disjoint to any other type.
%  \item $\boldsymbol{A = [[Int]], \ B = \ [[Int]]:}$ \\
%        $[[Int]]$ and $[[Int]]$ are not disjoint types because they share a common subtype $[[Int]]$ which
%        is not \emph{bottom-like}. In general, one type is not disjoint with
%        itself, unless it is bottom-like.
  \item $\boldsymbol{A = [[Int]], \ B = \ [[Top]]:}$
        $[[Int]]$ and $[[Top]]$ are not disjoint types because they share a common
    subtype $[[Int]]$ which is not \emph{bottom-like}. In general no type
    is disjoint to $[[Top]]$, except for \emph{bottom-like} types.
    Also, one type is not disjoint with itself, unless it is \emph{bottom-like}.
  \item $\boldsymbol{A = [[Int -> Bool]], \ B = \ [[String -> Char]]:}$
    The types $[[Int -> Bool]]$ and $[[String -> Char]]$ are not disjoint,
    since we can find non-bottom-like types that are subtypes
    of both types. For instance $[[Top -> Bot]]$ is a subtype of both types.
    More generally, any two function types can never be disjoint: it is always
    possible to find a common subtype, which is not \emph{bottom-like}.

\paragraph{Algorithmic Disjointness}
Declarative disjointness does not directly lead to an algorithm.
We present an algorithmic version of disjointness in
the middle part of \Cref{fig:union:disj-typ}.
\Rref{ad-btmr,ad-btml} state that the $[[Bot]]$
type is disjoint to all types.  \Rref{ad-intl,ad-intr} state that
$[[Int]]$ and $[[A -> B]]$ are disjoint types.  Algorithmic
disjointness can further be scaled to more primitive disjoint types
such as $Bool$ and $String$ by adding more rules similar to
\rref{ad-intl,ad-intr} for additional primitive types.
\Rref{ad-orl,ad-orr} are two symmetric rules for union types. Any type $[[C]]$ is
disjoint to an union type $[[A \/ B]]$ if $[[C]]$ is disjoint to both
$[[A]]$ and $[[B]]$.

We show that algorithmic disjointness is sound and complete
with respect to its declarative specification (\Cref{def:union:disj}).
% , and disjointness is a symmetric relation.
% The following lemmas summarize key properties of disjointness.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Typing
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Typing}
\label{sec:union:typ}
The typing rules are shown at the bottom of \Cref{fig:union:disj-typ}.
We adopt bi-directional type-checking~\cite{pierce2000local} in our calculus.  There
are two typing modes in bi-directional typing: inference mode
($[[=>]]$) and checking mode ($[[<=]]$). In the inference mode, the type of
an expression $[[e]]$ is inferred.  In the checking
mode, an expression $[[e]]$ is checked against a given type $[[A]]$.
Typing rules are mostly standard. An integer
expression $[[i]]$ infers type $[[Int]]$ as stated in \rref{typ-int}.
\Rref{typ-var} states that a variable $[[x]]$ infers type $[[A]]$ if
$[[x]]$ has type $[[A]]$ in the given context. \Rref{typ-ann}
checks an expression $[[e]]$ against the given type annotation $[[A]]$,
and infers type $[[A]]$.

\Rref{typ-app} is the standard bi-directional rule for
function application. In \rref{typ-app}, note that the type of the
function $[[e1]]$ is inferred. Thus the expression $[[e1]]$ should carry
its own type information, and it will typically include annotated lambdas.
On the other hand, the argument expression $[[e2]]$ is checked against type $[[A]]$,
and can itself be a function. For instance we could have $[[e2]] = \lambda x. x$
and $[[A]] = [[Int->Int]]$. In such case, during reduction, the argument would be
the unannotated value $\lambda x. x$.
\Rref{typ-sub} is the subsumption rule. It states that an expression
$[[e]]$ can be checked against any supertype of its inferred type.
\Rref{typ-abs} is the standard introduction rule for lambda
expressions. To check a lambda expression $[[\x.e]]$ against type $[[A
    -> B]]$, it is sufficient to check lambda body $[[e]]$ against the
output type $[[B]]$ in an extended context with parameter $[[x]]$ of
input type $[[A]]$.

The most interesting and novel typing rule is for
\emph{switch} expressions. There are four conditions.
%The remaining conditions are standard for a calculus with
%union types and case expression and have been studied in various
%calculi (\baber{reference to calculi}).
The first condition ($[[G |-
    e <= A \/ B]]$) ensures that the expression $[[e]]$ is well-typed
and checks against type $[[A \/ B]]$. Note that this condition ensures
\emph{exhaustiveness} of the cases in the switch: $e$ must
check against the types in the branches of the switch.
The next two conditions ensure that
branches of case expressions are well-typed and check against type
$[[C]]$, which is the overall type of the switch expression.
An important point in these two conditions is that variables
$[[x]]$ and $[[y]]$ are, respectively, of type $[[A]]$ in first branch and of type $[[B]]$ in
second branch in the extended context.
%\snow{So they are exhaustive for all possible values of $e$. In other words,
%at least one branch matches with the runtime type of $e$.}
The last condition
$[[A *s B]]$, guarantees the \emph{disjointness} of $[[A]]$ and $[[B]]$.
This ensures that overlapping types for the branches of case expressions
are forbidden. Otherwise, overlapping types could lead to
non-deterministic results.
Since all the branches check against $[[C]]$, the whole
switch expression checks against $[[C]]$.
Note that the two branches can have different return types.
For example, if $e_1$ and $e_2$ have type $[[Int]]$ and $[[String]]$ respectively,
the whole expression can be checked with the type $[[Int \/ String]]$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Operations Semantics
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Operational Semantics}
\label{sec:union:os}
The dynamics of \cal is defined by a small-step operational semantics. An
important aspect of the semantics is that it is type-directed
\cite{Huang:typedirected}: type annotations are used to guide reduction.
Similar terms that differ only on type annotations can reduce in different
ways.

\paragraph{Reduction rules}
\Cref{fig:union:os} shows operational semantics of \cal.
The operational semantics follows a call-by-value evaluation strategy.
\Rref{step-int} annotates integer expressions and makes them
values. \Rref{step-appl} is a standard call-by-value rule, reducing
the left expression of an application.
\Rref{step-appr} is almost a standard call-by-value rule, except
that we know that the left expression in the application must reduce
to an annotated value ($[[w]]$): non-annotated lambda expressions
($[[\x.e]]$) cannot appear at left side of applications.
%\ningning{\rref{step-appr} looks very fishy. Why $[[w]]$ on the left becomes
%  $[[v]]$ on the right?}
%Therefore, we have a condition of annotated value ($[[w]]$) at left
%side of applications instead of value $[[v]]$.
%\Rref{step-appr} then reduces right expression of application
%to a value.

%\bruno{Following text needs to be fixed after changes in Figure.}
\Rref{step-beta} is the beta-reduction rule. It applies a dually
annotated lambda value $[[\x.e : A1 -> B1 : A2 -> B2]]$ to input
value $[[v]]$. Substitution replaces free occurences of variable
$[[x]]$ with beta value ($[[betavalue v A2 A1]]$).
The definition of beta value ($[[betavalue v A B]]$) is shown at the lower part of
\Cref{fig:union:os}.
Beta value is a function which takes
value $[[v]]$ and both static and dynamic input types
($[[A1]]$ and $[[A2]]$) as input and returns value with
appropriate annotations to be substituted.
Recall that the values in \cal consist of $[[w]]$ and $[[\x.e]]$.
For first case, when $[[v]]$ is $[[w]]$ ($[[p:A]]$), beta value replaces the static type
$[[A]]$ (from $[[p:A]]$) by $[[A1]]$ and returns $[[p:A1]]$.
This is to keep the most specific type in the annotation, for beta-reduction.

Using only $[[A2]]$ may lead to ill-typed programs. Consider
the following example:
\[
  [[ (\x . e : Top -> Int : Int -> Int) (1:Int) ]]
  [[-->]] [[ (\x . e : Int->Int) (1:Int) ]]
  [[-->]] [[ e [ x~>1:Int ] ]]
\]
%
Here we assume that reduction does not keep the dynamic type of lambdas,
and we will not be able to know $[[A1]]$ when doing beta-reduction.
We further assume the lambda that contains a switch expression that analyzes
the function input. Say $[[e]]$ is $[[switch x Char e1 Bool e2]]$.
It is acceptable because $[[x]]$ has type $[[Top]]$.
The function expects a term of type top, but it is given a integer to.
The switch expression $[[e]]$, if we subsititute $[[x]]$ in it by $[[1 : Int]]$
it will be comes illegal because it has no branch dealt with an integer.
So we have to use the dynamic type $[[Top]]$ instead. And that is why
we need to keep two annotations for an lambda.
\end{comment}
For the second case, $[[v]]$ can also be an unnanotated lambda value $[[\x.e]]$.
With bi-directional type-checking an expression such as
$([[\f.f 1: (Int -> Int -> Int)]]) ([[\x.x]])$
is well-typed, since bi-directional type-checking propagates
type information to the arguments. Thus, the dynamic semantics
needs to deal with such programs.
In such case, substitution uses $[[\x.e:A2:A1]]$ as the value being substituted.




%Drop Static Type ($\rceil[[v]]\lceil$) drops the static type
%from annotated values $[[p:A]]$ and returns $[[p]]$.
%It does not change non-annotated values $[[\x.e]]$ and returns
%them as it is. The result expression $[[e1]]$ of ($\rceil[[v]]\lceil$)
%is either a pre-value $[[p]]$ or $[[\x.e]]$.
%Therefore, there are two cases to be considered in beta-reduction
%during substitution: one for pre-values and the other for $[[\x.e]]$.

%For the first case, note that the annotation of the pre-value
%$[[p]]$ changes from $[[p:A]]$ to $[[p:A2:A1]]$ during substitution.
%Specifically,
%$\rceil[[v]]\lceil$ drops $[[A]]$ from $[[p:A]]$ and returns $[[p]]$
%as $[[e1]]$. Substitution then
%substitutes free occurrences of variable $[[x]]$ with $[[e1:A2:A1]]$.
%\snow{Question about the rule design: why drop $A$? Substituting $x$ by
%$[[p:A:A2:A1]]$ should have the same effect as $[[p:A2:A1]]$.
%On the other hand, why adding $[[A2]]$ after dropping $[[A]]$
%instead of using $[[p:A1]]$?}
%\snow{For the above sentence: We need double annotation here because the
%result of function application might be a raw lambda, right?}
%The second case occurs when the
%argument of a function is a non-annotated lambda expression.

\Rref{step-ann}
reduces an annotated expression only if it is not an annotated value.
\Rref{step-rmann} drops inner
annotations, while keeping the static type.
\Rref{step-lamann} adds one more type annotation to
lambda expressions with only single type annotation to make them values.

\begin{comment}
\Rref{step-beta} deals with a special case, that occurs when the
argument of a function is a non-annotatted lambda expression.
With bi-directional type-checking an expression such as:
($[[\f.f 1:(Int -> Int -> Int) : (Int -> Int -> Int)]]$)($[[\x.x]]$)
\bruno{example here.} \baber{Done.}
is well-typed, since bi-directional type-checking propagates
type information to the arguments. Thus, the dynamic semantics
needs to deal with such programs.
We emphasize the fact that $[[\x.e]]$ is not a value in \cal.
The rule follows the same approach as
\rref{step-beta} except that both of the input types are kept with
$[[\x.e]]$ during substitution i.e $[[\x.e:A2:A1]]$. \Rref{step-ann}
reduces an annotated expression only if it is not a value and $[[e]]$
reduces to some $[[e']]$. \Rref{step-rmann} drops inner
annotations. \Rref{step-lamann} adds one more type annotation with
lambda expressions having single type annotation to make them values.

Of particular interest are
\rref{step-switch,step-switchl,step-switchr}, which deal with the reduction
of \emph{switch} expressions.
%\snow{I have the same linking problem for switchl/r rules here as well.
%Clicking them just bring me to the beginning of the pdf.}
\Rref{step-switch} reduces the case expression $[[e]]$.
\Rref{step-switchl} evaluates
the left branch of the \emph{switch} expression if the dynamic type of $[[p]]$ is
a subtype of type of left branch. \Rref{step-switchr} evaluates the right
branch if the type of $[[p]]$ is a subtype
of type of the right branch. The subtyping condition in
\rref{step-switchl,step-switchr} is important, as it provides
flexibility for the value to have various subtypes of $[[A]]$ and $[[B]]$, instead
of strictly having those types. Recall that
the typing rule for \emph{switch} (\rref{typ-switch}) requires that
types of left and right branches of a \emph{switch}
expression to be disjoint.
This ensures \rref{step-switchl,step-switchr} cannot overlap, which, as we will
see, is important for the
operational semantics to be \textit{deterministic}.
It is also important to note that non-annotated lambda expressions cannot appear
in the switch expression. Only annotated values appear in a switch expression.
%This is because that non-annotated lamda expressions do not preserve type
%and we cannot calculate the static type of non-annotated lambda expressions.
%Significance of static type is already explained above.


%\bruno{The following sentence is out-of-place. It should appear earlier
%  when we talk about disjointness. Perhaps you can state the property
%formally at that point.}

\begin{comment}
\paragraph{Dynamic Type} The dynamic semantics employs a simple
function that retrieves the dynamic type of a pre-value.
The definition is shown in the lower part of \Cref{fig:union:os}.
$[[Int]]$ is returned when $[[p]]$ is an integer $[[i]]$.
Otherwise, for functions, the function annotation $[[A -> B]]$ is returned.

\subsection{Type Safety and Determinism}
\label{sec:union:safety}
\cal is type sound and deterministic. Type soundness is established
by the type preservation and progress
theorems. Type preservation (\Cref{lemma:union:preservation}) states that
types are preserved during reduction. Progress
(\Cref{lemma:union:progress}) states that well typed programs never get
stuck.  A well typed expression $[[e]]$ is either a value or it can
take step to some other expression $[[e']]$. Therefore, preservation and progress
together ensure type safety.
%We add one more choice in the conclusion
%of progress lemma to handle non-annotated lambda expressions
%($[[\x.e]]$). This last condition is necessary because the type system
%employs bi-directional type checking and unannotated lambdas (which are not values)
%can be well-typed in the checking mode.

We further show that the operational semantics is deterministic
(\Cref{lemma:union:determinism}), which ensures
that a program will always produce the same unique result. This property is not
obvious as many operational semantics rules distinguish between pre-values,
values and annotated values. Also, by proving determinism, we guarantee that
switch expressions are not order-sensitive: at any time, only one of the
\rref{Step-Switchl,Step-Switchr} can be applied to a well-typed expression.
An essential property of \cal for determinism of the switch expression is
that a pre-value cannot check against two disjoint types as stated in
\Cref{lemma:union:check-both-disj-false}.
%This is in general true for all expressions, not just pre-values.

\begin{theorem}[Determinism]
\label{lemma:union:determinism}
  If \ $[[G |- e dirflag A]]$ and \ $[[e --> e1]]$ and \ $[[e --> e2]]$ then $[[e1]]$ = $[[e2]]$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Discussion on Disjointness
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{An Alternative Specification for Disjointness}
\label{sec:union:discussion}
\begin{comment}
\snow{I feel the reason and consequence are flipped here.
The alternative spec definitely equals to the previous one
because we define ``ordinary types" to satisfy:
1) no bottom-like types are ordinary;
2) any type must have an ordinary subtype if it is not bottom-like.
Or we need to provide some intuition for ordinary types themselves.}
\end{comment}

The current definition of disjointness (\Cref{def:union:disj}) is inspired
by work on disjoint intersection types~\cite{oliveira2016disjoint}. This definition works well
for the calculus presented in this section. However, it is not the only
possible formulation of disjointness.
An equivalent formulation of disjointness is:

\begin{definition}
    A $*_{s1}$ B $\Coloneqq$ $\forall$ C, $[[ordinary C]]$ $\Longrightarrow$ $\neg$ ($[[C <: A]]$ $\wedge$ $[[C <: B]]$)
    \label{def:union:disj1}
  \end{definition}

\noindent
The new disjointness definition (\Cref{def:union:disj1}) states that two
types are disjoint if they do not have common ordinary subtypes.
\emph{Ordinary types}, are essentially
those types that are primitive, such as integers and functions (see bottom
of Figure~\ref{fig:inter:system} for a formal definition).
The dynamic types of (pre-)values in \name are always ordinary.
%Consequentely values with a dynamic type $A$ should have an ordinary subtype $B$,
%such that $B <: A$.
%terms with bottom types cannot be reduced to values
%It is important to establish the fact that definition
%\Cref{def:union:disj1} is indeed equivalent to our current
%definition.

We prove that, for the calculus presented in this section, the new definition is
equivalent to the previous definition of disjointness
(\Cref{def:union:disj}).

\begin{lemma}[Disjointness Equivalence]
A $*_{s}$ B $\Longleftrightarrow$ A $*_{s1}$ B.
\end{lemma}

\noindent Why do we introduce the new definition of disjointness? It turns out that
\Cref{def:union:disj} is not sufficient when the calculus is extended with
intersection types, as in Section~\ref{sec:inter}. We will see,
\Cref{def:union:disj1} will play an important role in such variant of the calculus.
