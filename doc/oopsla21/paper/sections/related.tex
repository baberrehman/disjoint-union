\noindent We develop a union calculus (\cal) for type-based union elimination. 
We also add intersection types in
\cal. The calculus is proved to be sound, complete, type-safe and deterministic. Set-theoratic unions have
sound theory and extensively studied in mathematics. Set-theoratic unions correspond to union types
or disjoint union types in programming languages. Disjoint union types are also called sum types or variants.
Constructors are explicitly labeled in disjoint union types and expressions are manipulated using
corresponding labels. Few other interesting calculi (and this paper) do not use labels and provide type-based
union elimination. Developing a sound and deterministic union elimination construct
for type-based union elimination have been a challenge in research community.

Union types were first studied in the setting of programming languages by 
\citet{macqueen1984ideal}. Later on, union types have been studied in
the literature in various contexts. \citep{pierce1991programming} studied union types with intersection
types and polymorphism. But he did not define dynamic semantics for his calculus. Union elimination is same
in \citep{macqueen1984ideal} and \citep{pierce1991programming} and is not deterministic.
\citet{barbanera1995intersection} proposed two approaches for subject reduction in a calculus with
union types. However, their union elimination is same as last two and follow unrestricted union
elimination.

\citet{freeman1991refinement} studied union types in setting of refinement types for ML.
\baber{xduce, xduce and dunfield work.} Recently, \citet{muehlboeck2018empowering} gave a general framework of a calculi with intersection and 
union types. They illustrated the significane of their framework using Ceylon programming language.

\cite{} initially studied intersection types in programming languages literature.
Forsythe \cite{} implemented intersection types. Intersection types have been studied for
multi-field records \cite{}. \baber{dunfield work.}
Disjoint intersection types were studied by \citet{oliveira2016disjoint} to give a coherent
and deterministic caluclus for intersection types with merge operator. \cal discussed in \Cref{sec:union}
is dual to $\lambda_{i}$ by \citet{oliveira2016disjoint}.
