\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We develop a union calculus (\cal) for type-based union elimination. 
We also add intersection types in
\cal. The calculus is proved to be sound, complete, type-safe and deterministic.
Such calculi have a variety of practical applications such as in switch expressions
and function overloading. We plan to extend \cal for practical programming languages.

A major future research direction for \cal is to study it with merge operator.
Intersection types are of significant interest with merge operator. But it is non-trivial
to naivly add the merge operator for a calculus with union and intersection types.
One major problem with naive merge operator is that merge operator induces (in)coherence problem.
Therefore, special care has to be taken to study \cal with merge operator.
